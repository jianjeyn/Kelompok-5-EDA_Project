# Exploratory Data Analysis – Tourism & Economy in West Java

This project explores the relationship between **tourism growth** and **regional economic development** in West Java (Indonesia) using public datasets from **BPS** and **Open Data Jabar**. The analysis spans from **2018 to 2022**, covering the pandemic's impact and the post-COVID recovery era.

## Project Objectives

- Investigate how tourism metrics correlate with economic indicators.
- Understand the impact of tourism on local employment and UMKM growth.
- Visualize regional disparities across 27 cities/regencies in West Java.
- Extract insights to inform better policy and regional development decisions.

## Key Questions

1. Does the increase in tourist visits contribute to higher regional GDP (PDRB)?
2. Is tourism growth linked to more employment and fewer unemployment cases?
3. How do local tourism trends affect the development of UMKM (micro, small businesses)?
4. What patterns emerged before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic?
